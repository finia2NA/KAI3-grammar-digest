### example sentences:

## L26-1: てある
てある is used to emphasize that something has already been done, and the resulting state influences the present.

For the usage, just take the て form of a verb, and add あります。

It takes a 他動詞, but the を changes to が.  
*(or sometimes は, depending on the は/が rules)*

### ておきました vs てあります
てあります conveys the same information as ておきました: something has been done, and that is relevant right now.  
However, the focus is different.

ておきました focusses on the action, that *someone did it*.  
てあります focusses on the fact that the thing has been done, and the result of that.

- > エアコンがつけてあります -> *The aircon* is turned on now.
- > つけておきました -> *I turned on* the aircon.

It's essentially the difference between "It has been done" and "I have done it".

### Examples
- > お茶が買ってあります -> the tea has been bought.
- > 部屋が飾ってあります -> the room has been decorated


## L26-2: みたい、のよう
### みたい
みたい is used to say that something is *like* something else.  
みたい itself is a な adjective.

- > 雲が魚みたいです -> The cloud looks like a fish

- > イタリアは形がブーツみたいな国 -> Italy is the country with the shape like a boot

- > 怒ると、鬼みたいに怖いです -> If he get's angry, he gets scary like a demon

### のように
Instead of みたい, you can also say のよう.  
It's a lot more formal.

#### Examples
- > 仕事が山のようにあります

## L26-3: ようだ, みたい
- ようだ,みたい **with the plain forms of a verb** is used to say that something appears a certain way, based on *indirect information*.  
- For example, when your fish is gone and you see cat footprints:  
- 猫が食べたようです。
- It is related to level 1 そうだ, where the source of the information was external.
- Can also use みたい instead:

## L27-1: The Passive Form: 受身機
Japanese has a passive form.  
It is used whenever the subject of the sentence has no control over the predicate.  
More specific rules below.

It is formed like this:

- 一段 (Group 2): verb stem + られる
- 五段 (Group 1): <strike>a</strike> -> u + れる
- Irregulars:
  - する -> される
  - くる -> 来られる

- The passive recipient of the action is the subject of the sentence, while the active person / object is marked with に or から
  - (the usage is like もらう)
- Passive form 他動詞 Verbs can still take direct objects. See the examples.
- When forming the 受身機, there is no practical difference between 一段 and 五段.  
  - (In effect, you can apply the rule for 五段 to every regular verb).
- The result of this formation is a 一段 verb.
- The 可能け and 受身機 of 一段 verbs look the same (eg 食べられる).

### Usage
There are 3 Situations in which the 受身機 is used in Japanese.

#### Regular passive
When the subject of a story is of the receiving end of an action, the passive is used.

- > 田中さんは山田さんにさそわれました。 -> Tanakaさん was invited by Yamadaさん.
- > 娘は母に絵を褒められました。-> The daughter was praised by the mother for her drawing.

#### Talking about people being negatively affected by 他動詞
When talking about someone being hurt, emotionally or physically, by someone else doing something without their consent, the passive form is often used.

- > 林さんは森さんにケーキを食べられました。 -> Tanakaさん's cake was eaten by Moritaさん.
- > 小川さんは中野さんにロブレーターを読まられました。 -> Kogawaさん's love letter was read by Naganoさん.
- > 好きな人に断られました。-> I was rejected by the person I liked

#### Talking about people being negatively affected by 自動詞
When someone is negatively affected by someone/something doing a 自動詞 action, the passive form can also be used.

- > 新宿駅に、西田さんは女の人に泣かれました. -> Nishidaさん was cryed on by some woman at Shinjuku station.
- > 中田さんは雨に降られました -> Nakataさん was rained on.
- > 田中さんはセールスマンに家に来られました -> Tanakaさん interrupted by a salesman coming to her house.

### Usage, Part 2
#### Saying who made something:
If the person who made / built something is someone important of famous, instead of に, によって is used.

- > This building was built by Jonny Ive -> このビルはアイブジョンニによって建てられました。

#### Saying what something is made of / from
When the constituents of a thing are still discernable, we say the thing is made *of* those things.  
When the thing is made from things that have been processed irreversably, beyond recognition, we say it is made *from* those things.

Japanese makes this distinction too. *Of* translates to *で*, and *from* to *から*.

- > This building is made *of* stone. -> このビルは石*で*造れています。
- > 日本酒はお米*から*作れています。-> Sake is made *from* rice.

#### て form of 受身形
The passive has a て-form, which expresses state.

- > この本は多くの人に読まれています -> This book is read by many people

## Level 3 たら
In Level 3, たら is used to describe a situation of the type: *Because of something I did, I noticed something else happened / happening, that I cannot control*.  
It carries a surprised subtone, and often describes an unfortunate situation.

### Examples: 
- > スマホを落としたら、割れて*しまいました*。 -> I dropped my smartphone and it broke.
 - (Dropping the smartphone is my fault, the result I had no direct control over)

- > 古い牛乳を飲んだら、気持ちが悪くなりました。-> I drank old milk and got sick
  - (Drinking the milk is my fault, getting sick was out of my hands after that)

- > スーパーへ行ったら、偶然友達に会いました - > I went to the supermarket and met a friend by chance.
  - (Note: the second half of the sentence is often bad, but does not have to be. In this case, the meaning is simply that you were surprised.)

- > 箱を開けたら、皿が割れていました。-> I opened the box and the plates were broken
- (Because they were broken before; opening the box was not the action that caused them to break; only the thing that made me notice their ongoing state-of-brokenness, the て-form is used.)

- > 窓を開けたら、雪が降っていました。-> I opened my Window and noticed it snowing.
